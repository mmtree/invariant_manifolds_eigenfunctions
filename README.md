# Invariant manifolds eigenfunctions for 2D ODEs

Solve for 1-dimensional invariant manifolds numerically and then test whether the invariant manifolds can be combined to generate an eigenfunction.

(1) Find fixed points and eigenvectors using linearize.nb \
(2) Select starting values from linearization along eigenvector directions \
(3) Numerically integrate to determine invariant manifolds \
(4) Do linear regression to see if there is an eigenfunction
